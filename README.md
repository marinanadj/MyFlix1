# POKEDEX simple js app

## Description
This project was part of the Career Foundry Full Stack Web Development course. It's a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

The app displays a searchable list of pokemon names. When the user clicks on the name of a pokemon, a modal appears displaying further details on the pokemon (image, height, weight, and types) fetched from an external API.

The app uses the following API to load information on pokemon: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150

The app uses **Bootstrap** for styling purposes.

## Key features
* Load data from an external source (API)
* View a list of items
* On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item
